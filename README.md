codevember 02 // 2018.11.02 // Time

30 days, 30 creative experiments.
CodeVember is a challenge for developers creating a creative sketch by day during the whole month of November.

Playful-looking 7-seg display clock that depicts the changing of each digit in the clock by it breaking into its
individual segments and falling away to nothingness, never to be recovered. :worried:
